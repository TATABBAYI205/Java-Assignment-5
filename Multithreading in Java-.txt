Multithreading in Java:-
======================
Multithreading in Java refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program. A thread is a lightweight unit of execution that can run concurrently with other threads, allowing for parallel or concurrent processing of tasks.

Advantages:-
-> Concurrency and Responsiveness: Multithreading allows different parts of a program to execute independently and concurrently. This concurrency can improve the responsiveness of an application by enabling it to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, a user interface can remain responsive while background tasks are executed in separate threads.

-> Utilization of Multiple Processors/Cores: Multithreading enables the effective utilization of multiple processors or CPU cores. By dividing the workload among threads, a program can take advantage of parallel processing, which can lead to improved performance and faster execution times on multi-core systems.

-> Efficient Resource Management: Multithreading allows efficient utilization of system resources. For example, in a server application, multiple threads can handle incoming requests concurrently, avoiding unnecessary waiting and ensuring efficient resource utilization.

-> Modularity and Simplified Design: Threads can be used to modularize code and encapsulate independent tasks. By separating tasks into different threads, it becomes easier to reason about and manage the code. This can lead to simplified design and more maintainable code.

-> Asynchronous Operations: Multithreading facilitates asynchronous programming, where tasks can be executed independently in the background. This is particularly useful when dealing with time-consuming or blocking operations, such as network communication or file I/O. Asynchronous operations can prevent the entire program from waiting and enable concurrent execution of other tasks.

-> Parallel Algorithms and Data Processing: Multithreading allows the execution of parallel algorithms, where a large problem can be divided into smaller sub-problems that can be processed concurrently. This can significantly speed up the execution of computationally intensive tasks and data processing operations.
