Exception Handling in Java:-
==========================
-> Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved. Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.
-> In Java, exception handling is accomplished through the use of try-catch blocks. The code that might throw an exception is enclosed within the try block, and the corresponding exception handlers are defined in the catch blocks. Here's a general syntax of a try-catch.

syntax:-

try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
    // ...
} catch (ExceptionType1 ex1) {
    // Exception handler for ExceptionType1
    // ...
} catch (ExceptionType2 ex2) {
    // Exception handler for ExceptionType2
    // ...
} finally {
    // Optional: Code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
    // ...
}
