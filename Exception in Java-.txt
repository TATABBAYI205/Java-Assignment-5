Exception in Java:-
=================
-> Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, i.e. at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions.

It contains information about the exception, such as the name and description of the exception and the state of the program when the exception occurred.
