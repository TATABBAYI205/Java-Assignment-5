The throw keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code. We can throw either checked or unchecked exception.

Java throws:-
===========
throws is a keyword in Java that is used in the signature of a method to indicate that this method might throw one of the listed type exceptions. The caller to these methods has to handle the exception using a try-catch block. 

Syntax:-
type method_name(parameters) throws exception_list

exception_list is a comma separated list of all the 
exceptions which a method might throw.

Important Points to Remember about throws Keyword:-
-> throws keyword is required only for checked exceptions and usage of the throws keyword for unchecked exceptions is meaningless.
-> throws keyword is required only to convince the compiler and usage of the throws keyword does not prevent abnormal termination of the program.
-> With the help of the throws keyword, we can provide information to the caller of the method about the exception.
